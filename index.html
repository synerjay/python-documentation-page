            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
            efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
            approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
            dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
            ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
            many areas on most platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
            available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
            Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
            distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and
            pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and
            tools, and additional documentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and
            data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from
            C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for
            customizable applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
            and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a
            Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples
            are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python
            Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal
            definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read
            Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API
            Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in
            depth.
          </p>

          <p>
            This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every
            single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it
            introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give
            you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading
            it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs,
            and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library
            modules described in The Python Standard Library.

            In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
            presence or absence of prompts (<code>>>></code> and
            <code>…</code>): to repeat the example, you must type everything
            after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin
            with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary
            prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank
            line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the
            interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with
            the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
            comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or
            code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a
            string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to
            clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted
            when typing in examples.
          </p>
          Some examples:

          <pre><code>
        # this is the first comment
        spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
                  # ... and now a third!
        text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
      </code></pre>

          <p>
            Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and
            wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Operations
              <p>
                The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
                expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax
                is straightforward: the operators <code>+</code>, <code></code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> work just like
                in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses
                (<code>()</code>) can be used for grouping. For example:
              </p>
              <pre><code>
              >>> 2 + 2
              4
              >>> 50 - 5*6
              20
              >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
              5.0
              >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
              1.6
            </code> </pre>
              <p>
                The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type <code>int</code>, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type <code>float</code>. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Division (<code>/</code>) always returns a float.
              <p>
                To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the <code>//</code> operator; to calculate the remainder you can use <code>%</code>:
              </p>
              <pre><code>
                >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
                5.666666666666667
                >>>
                >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
                5
                >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
                2
                >>> 5 * 3 + 2  # result * divisor + remainder
                17
          </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              The equal sign (<code>=</code>) is used to assign a value to a variable.
              <p>
                Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:
              </p>
              <pre><code>
                >>> width = 20
                >>> height = 5 * 9
                >>> width * height
                900
          </code></pre>
            </li>

          <p>
            Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
          </p>

          <p>It does so taking in consideration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>spcificity</li>
            <li>importance</li>
            <li>inheritance</li>
            <li>order in the file</li>
          </ul>
          <pre><code>
            >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
            >>> squares
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      </code></pre>
      <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
      <pre><code>
        >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
        1
        >>> squares[-1]
        25
        >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
        [9, 16, 25]
        </code></pre>
        <p>All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list:</p>
        <pre><code>
          >>> squares[:]
      [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      </code></pre>
